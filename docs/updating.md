# Updating

Apart from the automatic update checker, you can check for new updates from the main window or rightclicking the systray icon and selecting 'check for updates'. If there's an update, HASS.Agent can download and install it for you.

If you're using the installer, it'll launch HASS.Agent for you when it's done. But if you've updated manually, just doubleclick `HASS.Agent.exe`.
